Low Poly Shooter Pack | Unreal Engine
==============================

The Low Poly Shooter Pack makes it easier than ever to make
high-quality shooter games by providing you with ready-made systems,
animations, 3D models and many more!

Highly Polished Content |:arrows_counterclockwise:|
    We strive to release content that is ultra polished so we can
    confidently say that any game made using this pack will look and
    feel like a good game.
    
    Learning from popular games is very important for us too, which is 
    why some of our features may resemble ones from super popular games!
    
Commented Codebase |:heartbeat:|
    Our big codebase is full of helpful comments explaining why the code
    is written the way it is, and what each litle things does.
    
    We built this way so you, as the developers, would be able to use, 
    modify and learn from it without having to guess what everything is,
    and does.

You can find out more about our all the :doc:`/features` in these pages.
